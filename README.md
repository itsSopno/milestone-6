###1) What is the difference between var, let, and const?
Ans : The difference between them is that the value of a variable declared with const cannot be changed, while the value of a variable declared with let can be changed. Before ES6, variables were declared with var.


###2) What is the difference between map(), forEach(), and filter()?
Ans : If I run Map() on an Array, it will return a new array. On the other hand, if I do ForEach(), it will not return anything. And if I use Filter(), it will return the elements that meet the condition in an array.

###3) What are arrow functions in ES6?
Ans : const som = () => {}
Arrow functions are suitable for small and simple tasks and callback functions.


###4) How does destructuring assignment work in ES6?
Ans : function doubleThem(a,b){ return [a * 2 , b * 2]; } 
const [prothom , ditiyo] = double them(6,9);
console.log(prothom,ditiyo)


###5) Explain template literals in ES6. How are they different from string concatenation?
Ans: 1 .Cleaner syntax
2.Easier to maintain (especially for long strings)
3.Powerful (can include logic, loops, functions)
